# üîå Lab 2: Network Media Breakdown

## üìç Objective
To explore and compare common network media types based on real-world usage, cable structure, and performance. This supports Module 6 in the Cisco course.

## üß∞ Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer (optional)
- Google Images (for cable types)
- Markdown (for table formatting)

## üì° Media Types

There are three major physical media used in networking:

| Media Type     | Description                           | Speed Range         | Cost       | Use Case                         |
|----------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------|------------|----------------------------------|
| Twisted Pair   | Copper wires twisted to reduce noise  | 10 Mbps ‚Äì 10 Gbps   | Low        | Home + Office Ethernet           |
| Coaxial Cable  | Single copper core, thick insulation  | 10 Mbps ‚Äì 1 Gbps    | Medium     | Cable TV + Older Networks        |
| Fiber Optic    | Glass strands transmitting light      | 100 Mbps ‚Äì 100+ Gbps| High       | Backbone, Long Distance, ISPs    |

## üí≠ Reflection

This lab helped me understand where and why each type of cable is used, how media affects speed and cost, and how to choose based on environment.

In the future, I‚Äôll compare real-world patch cables in my home or lab.
